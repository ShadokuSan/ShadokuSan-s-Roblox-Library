### **Usage**

Simply use **require(3165359492)** or insert the module manually to use it (but don't forget that requiring a ModuleScript via an ID doesn't work in LocalScripts).

For the sake of the examples in the functions list below, let's assume **Code** is the variable used:

```lua
local Code = require(3165359492)
```

<details><summary><h3>Variables List</h3></summary>

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Script | Refers to the module's instance itself. |
| Warnings | Tied to the **Warnings** attribute to the module. This is used to give information in some scripts for potentially incorrect uses but is an instance that may be auto-corrected. |
| ManualErrors | Tied to the **ManualErrors** attribute to the module. Normally, this will insert errors in areas where incorrect usage of the module likely cannot be auto-corrected and tries to send a message that will try to make some sense of what went wrong. |
| Formulas | This is a table that hosts multiple semi-commonly used formulas, put into function form. See [Formulas](#formulas) for more information. |

### Formulas

This is a table that hosts multiple semi-commonly used formulas, put into function form. Followed by, `Code.Formulas.NameHere`

| Forumla Name | Format | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GetAngleVector2 | GetAngleVector2(Position1: Vector2, Position2: Vector2) | Returns an angle where **Position1** points at **Position2**. |
| RayReflection | RayReflection (DirectionNormal: Vector3, SurfaceNormal: Vector3, Modifier: number?) | Returns a Vector3 direction/normal by taking the **DirectionNormal** and bouncing it off of the **SurfaceNormal**; angle depends on the **Modifier** which is defaulted at 2. |
| PythagoreanTheorem | PythagoreanTheorem(Number1: number, Number2: number) | Simply returns the result of âˆš**Number1**<sup>2</sup> + **Number2**<sup>2</sup> |
| PointOnRay | PointOnRay(Point1: Vector3, Point2: Vector3, ReferencePoint: Vector3) | Returns a position by making a ray/line between **Point1** and **Point2**, then uses the **ReferencePoint** to find the closest position from said line. |
| Lerp | Lerp(Start: number, End: number, Alpha: number) | Returns the number between the **Start** and **End** based on the Alpha (between 0-1). |
| TimeConvert | TimeConvert(Seconds: number, TimeUnit: string<"Milliseconds", "Seconds", "Hours", "Days", "Weeks">) | Returns the conversion of seconds to another time unit. |

<details><summary>Tweens</summary>

**Description:** A method for making multiple tweens of the same or similar items.

**Setup:** `Code.Tweens(Instances...){Time, Style, Direction, Repeat, Reverses, Delay}{Properties}`

**Returns:** Nothing.
| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Instances | Instance | nil | The Instances in which you wish to tween. |
| Time | number | 1 | How long it takes the tween to complete. |
| Style | Enum / number / string | Linear | The EasingStyle of the tween. |
| Direction | Enum / number / string | InOut | The EasingDirection of the tween. |
| Repeat | number | 0 | How many times the tween will repeat. |
| Reverses | boolean | false | Determines if the tween will do the inverse after finishing. |
| Delay | number | 0 | The amount of time that elapses before tween starts in seconds. |
| Properties | table | {} | The properties that are being changed by the tween. Generally numerical. |

This function hosts some special inputs<sub>*Not all may apply*</sub>. Make sure to check the [On Changing Values](#on-changing-values) section for details on how to use them.

### Usage Example

```lua
local Part1,Part2 = workspace.Part1,workspace.Part2
Code.Tweens(Part1,Part2){1,"Bounce","Out",1,true,0.5}{Position=Vector3.new(0,5,0)}
```

**Note:** This auto-plays all of the tweens made. I intended it to return each tween individually similarly to the Service function, but something ROBLOX-side seems to be preventing this from working as of this update.

<details><summary>âš  TweenSequence</summary>

:warning: This is experimental, and may cause poor performance if used too sparingly!

**Description:** An experimental method to tween what was previously untweenable.

**Setup:** `Code.TweenSequence(Instances...){Time, Style, Direction, Repeat, Reverses, Delay}{Properties}`

**Returns:** A special tween-base made via metatables. Should be able to work just like a normal Tween with the same functions and variables. This includes a new function: **Tween:Destroy()** since this works in a specific way, if you want to clean up a bit, I recommend you use this when not needed anymore.
| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Instances | Instance | nil | The Instances in which you wish to tween. |
| Time | number | 1 | How long it takes the tween to complete. |
| Style | Enum / number / string | Linear | The EasingStyle of the tween. |
| Direction | Enum / number / string | InOut | The EasingDirection of the tween. |
| Repeat | number | 0 | How many times the tween will repeat. |
| Reverses | boolean | false | Determines if the tween will do the inverse after finishing. |
| Delay | number | 0 | The amount of time that elapses before tween starts in seconds. |
| Properties | table | {} | The properties that are being changed by the tween. In this case, restricted. |

## **What can be tweened currently**

### ColorSequence

If the start and end sequences have differing number keypoints, 2 new sequences will be created with some "ghost keypoints" in the middle to still generally reflect what the start and end should look like. Then, when tweening, each color's keypoint is lerped over each other to give a fading effect.

If the number of keypoints remains the same and the start of the property name has a tilde (**~**), then it will attempt to also tween the time position of the keypoints between the start and end points, giving a sliding effect on top of the color changing effect.

### NumberSequence

Works largely similar to ColorSequence, but instead with colors it deals in numbers and envelopes. The tilde rule also applies here.

### Usage Example

```lua
----Example 1
local Beam = workspace.Part1.Beam
local ChangeTo = ColorSequence.new{
 ColorSequenceKeypoint.new(0,Color3.fromRGB(0, 0, 0)),
 ColorSequenceKeypoint.new(0.25,Color3.fromRGB(255, 0, 0)),
 ColorSequenceKeypoint.new(0.5,Color3.fromRGB(0, 255, 0)),
 ColorSequenceKeypoint.new(0.75,Color3.fromRGB(0, 0, 255)),
 ColorSequenceKeypoint.new(1,Color3.fromRGB(0, 0, 0))}

local Tween = Code.TweenSequence(Beam){1,"Linear","InOut",2,true,0.5}{Color = ChangeTo}
Tween:Play()
--Should tween any beam's colors to look a bit rainbow-like, reverts back, and does this a couple of times.

----Example 2
local ParticleEmitter = workspace.Part5.ParticleEmitter
local ChangeTo = NumberSequence.new{
 NumberSequenceKeypoint.new(0,1),
 NumberSequenceKeypoint.new(0.349,3.39,1.58),
 NumberSequenceKeypoint.new(1,1)}

local Tween = Code.TweenSequence(ParticleEmitter){1,"Linear","InOut",2,true,0.5}{["~Size"> = ChangeTo}
Tween:Play()
Tween.Completed:Wait()
print("Demo finished!")
--Should tween a particle emitter's size, sliding the values if the initial NumberSequence is also 3 keypoints.
```

### Usage Example

```lua
--Let's assume this is a normal script, and Parts is a folder in the workspace that contains a few blocks.
function Reader(Part,Event,...)
    if Event=="Changed" then
    print(Part.Name,"was changed! Changed:",...)

</details>

<details><summary>WaitOn</summary>

**Description:** Can wait on multiple occasions, but will resume as soon as 1 of them is met.

**Setup:** `Code.WaitOn(Variant...)`

    ["Days"] = 0,
    ["Hours"] = 0,
    ["Milliseconds"] = 0,
    ["Minutes"] = 1,
    ["Seconds"] = 5,
    ["Weeks"] = 0
    }]]
```

___
</details>

<details><summary>TimeFormat</summary>

**Description:** Takes any number of seconds and converts that to a time format of your choosing.

**Setup:** `Code.TimeFormat(Seconds, Format, Simple)`

**Returns:** A string containing the newly formatted time.
| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Seconds | number | 0 | How many seconds you want to convert and format. |
| Format | string | **nil** | How the string should be presented. See below category for more details. |
| Simple | boolean | true | If the conversion can be used without any words in the string. |

### Format Guides
The string for the **Format** variable looks for certain patterns to determine where to place the converted time units. This goes to Milliseconds, Seconds, Minutes, Hours (24 hour, not 12 hour time), Days, and Weeks. Months and onward are excluded for being too variable; not every month has a set amount of days or weeks. When using these patterns, keep in mind that these are case sensitive:

| Pattern | Time Unit | Number Range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mi | Milliseconds | 0 - 9999 |
| S | Seconds | 0 - 59 |
| M | Minutes | 0 - 59 |
| H | Hours | 0 - 23 |
| D | Days | 0 - 6 |
| W | Weeks | No Limit |

Units such as Seconds or Hours do not display their limits of 60 or 24 since at that number they will convert to the next unit of time. 60 seconds to +1 minute.

Note that when the **Simple** variable is set to *false*, you will instead need to use every pattern with an underscore before it. So **Mi** will now be **_Mi**. See Usage Examples to see why this can be useful.

### Usage Example

```lua
--Example 1: Simple timer conversion for 65 seconds.
local Time = Code.TimeFormat(65, "MM:SS.MiMiMi", true)
print(Time)
    --Expected output: "01:05.000"

--Example 2: Take's Example 1 but removes the excess zero from the minutes, and removes the milliseconds.
local Time = Code.TimeFormat(65, "M:SS")
print(Time)
    --Expected output: "1:05"
    --Note that the third variable is true by default, so it is unecessary to include here.

--Example 3: Displays 3 Hours  1 Minute  20.5 Seconds
local Time = Code.TimeFormat(60^2 * 3 + 80.5, "HH:MM:SS.MiMiMi")
print(Time)
    --Expected output: "03:01:20.500"
 
 --Example 4: How to utilize the third variable to be false to display more accurate information. This will display 6 days  1 Minute  20 Seconds
local Time = Code.TimeFormat(60^2 * 24 * 6 + 80, "_D Days _HH:_MM:_SS._MiMiMi", false)
print(Time)
    --Expected output: "6 Days 00:01:20.000"
    --Had we not set the Simple variable to false, this function would have attempted to convert the word Days to a number for the number of Days as well since it starts with a D.

local Part = workspace.Brick
Code.SetAttributes(Part,{TestString="String!",TestNumber=5,TestBoolean=true})
local A,B,C,D = Code.GetAttributes(Part,"TestNumber","TestString","TestBrick","TestBoolean")
--A would be 5
--B would be "String!"
--C would be false since there is no match
--D would be true

----Example 2
local Part = workspace.Brick

This list is specifically for the functions where changing the properties of an Instance is possible.

### On Changing Values

| Name | Type | Effects | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Same# | Property Name | Any | Allows you to set multiple properties to the same value. Provide a table where the first entry is the value you want to be set, then each subsequent entry is a string that is the name of the property you want to change. As long as the **#** at the end is a different number, you can use this as many times as necessary. | {Same1 = {true, "Anchored", "CanCollide"}, Same2 = {false,"CastShadow", "Locked"}} |
| Sides | Property Name | Surfaces | Changes all of the sides for BaseParts at the same time. | {Sides = "Smooth"} |
| "nil" | Value | ObjectValues | Allows you to set a property to `nil` where applicable. | {Adornee = "nil"} |
| "+#" | Value | Numbers | Adds the number **#** to the original value being changed. | {Value = "+0.5"} |
| "-#" | Value | Numbers | Subtracts the number **#** to the original value being changed. | {Value = "-0.5"} |
| "*#" | Value | Numbers | Multiplies the number **#** with the original value being changed. | {Value = "*2"} |
| "/#" | Value | Numbers | Divides the number **#** from the original value being changed. | {Value = "/2"} |
| "^#" | Value | Numbers | Sets the original value to the power of number **#**. | {Value = "^2"} |
| "sqrt" | Value | Numbers | Returns the square root of the number being changed. | {Value = "sqrt"} |
| "negate" | Value | Numbers | Basically inverts the number from negative/positive to the other. | {Value = "negate"} |
| "not" | Value | Booleans | Returns the opposite boolean value. | {Value = "not"} |
| Function | Value | Any | Inputs a function to return a value of your choosing. The first/only value of the function is always the Instance being changed. | See [Expanded Examples](#expanded-examples) for this instance. |
| "~X,Y,Z" | Value | Vector3 | Changes the Vector3 relative to its current value. The **X**, **Y**, and **Z** variables are the X,Y, and Z of the Vector3 Value. No spaces should be present in here. | {Position = "~0,5,0"} |
| **"~#,#,#"** | Value | CFrame | Translates as ToWorldSpace(CFrame). | {CFrame = "~0,0,-5"} |
| **"@#,#,#"** | Value | CFrame | Translates as CFrame*CFrame.fromEulerAnglesXYZ(#,#,#). Automatically converted to math.rad(#). | {CFrame = "@90,0,45"} |
| **"<#,#,#,#,#,#"** | Value | CFrame | Basically acts as the **~** and then applies the **@** changes. First three #'s affect the movement and the other three affect the rotation. | {CFrame = "<0,5,0,0,45,0"} |
| **">#,#,#,#,#,#"** | Value | CFrame | Basically acts as the **@** and then applies the **~** changes. First three #'s affect the movement and the other three affect the rotation. | {CFrame = ">0,5,0,0,45,0"} |

### Expanded Examples

```lua
--Function
--Moves each part in your PartTable 5 studs up independently of each other and their rotation.
function Func(Part)
return Part.CFrame:ToWorldSpace(CFrame.new(0,5,0))
end

Code.Change(PartTable){CFrame = Func}
```

### On Searching Values

| Name | Type | Effects | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IsA | Property Name | Instances | Works just like **Part:IsA("BasePart"). | {IsA = "BasePart"} |
| IsPartOf | Property Name | Instances | Works with this module's **IsPartOf** function, though requires a slightly different setup. | See [Expanded Examples](#expanded-examples-1) for this instance. |
| Attribute | Property Name | Instances | Looks for 1 attribute to match to. | {Attribute = {"Attribute Name", DesiredValue} |
| ">#" | Value | Numbers | Detects anything greater than the **#** in its place. | {Transparency = ">0.5"} |

| String... | Value | Strings | Checks if the desired String is at the start of the value.  | {Name = "Brick..."}  |
| ...String... | Value | Strings | Checks if the desired String is anywhere inside of the value.  | {Name = "...Brick..."}  |
| "R" | Value | Color3 | Checks if the **R** value is greater than **B** and **G** . | {Color = "R"} |
