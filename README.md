### **Usage**

Simply use **require(3165359492)** or insert the module manually to use it (but don't forget that requiring a ModuleScript via an ID doesn't work in LocalScripts).

For the sake of the examples in the functions list below, let's assume **ShadLibrary** is the variable used:

```lua
local ShadLibrary = require(3165359492)
```

<details><summary><h3>Variables List</h3></summary>

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Script | Refers to the module's instance itself. |
| Warnings | Tied to the **Warnings** attribute to the module. This is used to give information in some scripts for potentially incorrect uses but is an instance that may be auto-corrected. |
| ManualErrors | Tied to the **ManualErrors** attribute to the module. Normally, this will insert errors in areas where incorrect usage of the module likely cannot be auto-corrected and tries to send a message that will try to make some sense of what went wrong. |
| Formulas | This is a table that hosts multiple semi-commonly used formulas, put into function form. See [Formulas](#formulas) for more information. |

### PropertyType Usage

â€¢ **Match:** When searching for the Name and ClassName of the Instance, it will now also check if the Properties from the Properties Table match.

â€¢ **Force:** If an Instance is found that has the correct Name and ClassName, it will automatically change the rest of its properties from that of the Properties table.

â€¢ `false` Will do neither.

### Usage Example

```lua
--Example 1: 
--[[
    Searches the game's ReplicatedStorage for a RemoteEvent named "MyRemote".

    Since the 4th variable is false and a RemoteEvent doesn't have any other notable properties,
    the following Properties table here is left empty since it does nothing in this situation.

    If this RemoteEvent did not exist, then this would have automatically made a new RemoteEvent
    with the name "MyRemote" under the game's ReplicatedStorage.

    Note that in any situation where a new Instance needs to be made, it will be parented after every
    other property is set.
]]

local RemoteEvent = ShadLibrary.GetInstance(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage"), "MyRemote", "RemoteEvent", false){}

--Example 2:
--[[ Searches the Workspace for a NumberValue named "MyNumber" and also has the value of 5 since the
    4th variable is set to "Match"

    If the 4th variable was set to false and a new instance needed to be made, the function would not
    check if the NumberValue had a value of 5 but would still make a new NumberValue that does have a value of 5.
]]

local NumberValue = ShadLibrary.GetInstance(workspace, "MyNumber", "NumberValue", "Match"){
	properties = {
		Value = 5
	}
}

--Example 3:
--[[ Searches the Workspace for a NumberValue named "MyNumber" and will set its value to 5 since the
    4th variable was set to "Force"
]]

local NumberValue = ShadLibrary.GetInstance(workspace, "MyNumber", "NumberValue", "Force"){
	properties = {
		Value = 5
	}
}

## **What can be tweened currently**

### ColorSequence

If the start and end sequences have differing number keypoints, 2 new sequences will be created with some "ghost keypoints" in the middle to still generally reflect what the start and end should look like. Then, when tweening, each color's keypoint is lerped over each other to give a fading effect.

If the number of keypoints remains the same and the start of the property name has a tilde (**~**), then it will attempt to also tween the time position of the keypoints between the start and end points, giving a sliding effect on top of the color changing effect.

### NumberSequence

Works largely similar to ColorSequence, but instead with colors it deals in numbers and envelopes. The tilde rule also applies here.

### Usage Example

```lua
----Example 1
local Beam = workspace.Part1.Beam
local ChangeTo = ColorSequence.new{
 ColorSequenceKeypoint.new(0, Color3.fromRGB(0, 0, 0)),
 ColorSequenceKeypoint.new(0.25, Color3.fromRGB(255, 0, 0)),
 ColorSequenceKeypoint.new(0.5, Color3.fromRGB(0, 255, 0)),
 ColorSequenceKeypoint.new(0.75, Color3.fromRGB(0, 0, 255)),
 ColorSequenceKeypoint.new(1, Color3.fromRGB(0, 0, 0))}

local Tween = ShadLibrary.TweenSequence(Beam, 1, "Linear", "InOut", 2, true, 0.5){Color = ChangeTo}
Tween:Play()
--Should tween any beam's colors to look a bit rainbow-like, revert, and does this a couple of times.

----Example 2
local ParticleEmitter = workspace.Part5.ParticleEmitter
local ChangeTo = NumberSequence.new{
 NumberSequenceKeypoint.new(0, 1),
 NumberSequenceKeypoint.new(0.349, 3.39, 1.58),
 NumberSequenceKeypoint.new(1, 1)}

local MyInfo = TweenInfo.new(1, Enum.EasingStyle.Linear, Enum.EasingDirection.InOut, 2, true, 0.5)

local Tween = ShadLibrary.TweenSequence(ParticleEmitter, MyInfo){["~Size"] = ChangeTo}
Tween:Play()
Tween.Completed:Wait()
print("Demo finished!")
--Should tween a particle emitter's size, sliding the values if the initial NumberSequence is also 3 keypoints.

--Instance being the instance.
--Event is a string of the event you chose to connect.
local VarA, VarB, VarC, etc = ...
--or
local Variables = {...}

    ["Minutes"] = 1,
    ["Seconds"] = 5,
    ["Weeks"] = 0
    }]]
```

___
</details>

<details><summary>TimeFormat</summary>

**Description:** Takes any number of seconds and converts that to a time format of your choosing.

**Setup:** `ShadLibrary.TimeFormat(Seconds, Format, Simple)`

**Returns:** A string containing the newly formatted time.
| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Seconds | number | REQUIRED | How many seconds you want to convert and format. |
| Format | string | REQUIRED | How the string should be presented. See below category for more details. |
| Simple | boolean | true | If the conversion can be used without any words in the string. |

### Format Guides
The string for the **Format** variable looks for certain patterns to determine where to place the converted time units. This goes to Milliseconds, Seconds, Minutes, Hours (24 hour, not 12 hour time), Days, and Weeks. Months and onward are excluded for being too variable; not every month has a set amount of days or weeks. When using these patterns, keep in mind that these are case sensitive:

| Pattern | Time Unit | Number Range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mi | Milliseconds | 0 - 9999 |
| S | Seconds | 0 - 59 |
| M | Minutes | 0 - 59 |
| H | Hours | 0 - 23 |
| D | Days | 0 - 6 |
| W | Weeks | No Limit |

Units such as Seconds or Hours do not display their limits of 60 or 24 since at that number they will convert to the next unit of time. 60 seconds to +1 minute.

Note that when the **Simple** variable is set to *false*, you will instead need to use every pattern with an underscore before it. So **Mi** will now be **_Mi**. See Usage Examples to see why this can be useful.

### Usage Example

```lua
--Example 1: Simple timer conversion for 65 seconds.
local Time = ShadLibrary.TimeFormat(65, "MM:SS.MiMiMi", true)
print(Time)
    --Expected output: "01:05.000"

--Example 2: Takes Example 1 but removes the excess zero from the minutes, and removes the milliseconds.
local Time = ShadLibrary.TimeFormat(65, "M:SS")
print(Time)
    --Expected output: "1:05"
    --Note that the third variable is true by default, so it is unnecessary to include here.

--Example 3: Displays 3 Hours  1 Minute  20.5 Seconds
local Time = ShadLibrary.TimeFormat(60^2 * 3 + 80.5, "HH:MM:SS.MiMiMi")
print(Time)
    --Expected output: "03:01:20.500"
 
 --Example 4: How to utilize the third variable to be false to display more accurate information. This will display 6 days  1 Minute  20 Seconds
local Time = ShadLibrary.TimeFormat(60^2 * 24 * 6 + 80, "_D Days _HH:_MM:_SS._MiMiMi", false)
print(Time)
    --Expected output: "6 Days 00:01:20.000"
    --Had we not set the Simple variable to false, this function would have attempted to convert the word Days to a number for the number of Days as well since it starts with a D.
